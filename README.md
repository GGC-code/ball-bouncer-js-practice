# Ball Bounce

A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that simulates a bouncing ball on a platform using the keyboard.

By holding down any key, the ball moves up; when the key is released, the ball falls down thanks to a CSS transition.

## Features

- Vertical ball animation
- Keyboard control (any key)
- Smooth movement using CSS transitions
- Responsive layout based on `vw` and `vh`
- **Reset** button (currently visual only)

## How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Press and hold any key:
   - the ball moves up
3. Release the key:
   - the ball moves down

The vertical movement is handled by changing the CSS `bottom` property of the ball.
